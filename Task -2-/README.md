#### 1. Conceiving The Purpose of Software

First of all, you should understand the purpose of the software. There is, in fact, a single purpose of all software: **To help people**.

> Remember: the purpose of the software is not to show off how 
>intelligent you are. — Max Kanat-Alexander, Code Simplicity.

Developers who cannot conceive the purpose of the software will write bad software. What is bad software? A complex system that doesn’t help people that much.

When you are making decisions about software, you should guide yourself by always keeping this in mind: How we can help? You can even prioritize feature requests this way.

#### 2. The Goals of Software Design

##### Every programmer is a designer

When software is hard to create or modify, developers spend most of their time focusing on making things “just work,” and less time focusing on helping users. The design of software aims to make developers job as easy as possible so they can focus on what matters. You will create software that will help users and your software will continue to help them for a long time.

However, if you design a bad system, your software’s lifetime will be short

>To design systems that can be created and maintained as easily as
>possible by their developers, so that they can be — and continue to be — as
>helpful as possible. — Max Kanat-Alexander, Code Simplicity
